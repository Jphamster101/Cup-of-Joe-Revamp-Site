                    We are dedicated to sourcing direct trade, fair trade, organic and shade grown beans. Direct trade and fair trade coffee ensures growers are given a fair market value for their crop. This ultimately leads to a better product for you. You can sip our coffee knowing that we are committed to fair practices.
