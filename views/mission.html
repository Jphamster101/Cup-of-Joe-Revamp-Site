                    We are dedicated to sourcing direct trade, fair trade, organic and shade grown beans. Direct trade and fair trade coffee ensures growers are given a fair market value for their crop. This ultimately leads to a better product for you. You can sip our coffee knowing that we are committed to fair practices.

                    As a proud supporter of local food sourcing, we provide a wide selection of homemade baked goods on a daily basis. Our in house bakers create a fresh assortment of unique pastries and savory treats including wheat free and vegan options - you can always count on a variety of freshness.
